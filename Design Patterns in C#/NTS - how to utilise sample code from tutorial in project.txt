1/ Create target folder.
2/ Open Visual Studio.
3/ Create New Project -> select Console App.
4/ Give project name and select target folder.
5/ Overwrite the .cs file with the sample code.

Note:
Some sample code may not work because there is no main entry point. In these cases, if the code is only demonstrating the lesson objective through non-functional means then it is not important.

To modify so there is a main entry point, move/ create the Main method out of any other class and place it in a separate class at the namespace level, not nested within any class. This class could be called 'Program' which is a common convention for the entry point in C# applications. For example:

    ...

    // This class is added to contain the Main method
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ...

            new Anything(another);
        }
    }
}
